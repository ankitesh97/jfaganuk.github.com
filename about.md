I am a [PhD candidate in Management](http://gatton.uky.edu/Content.asp?PageName=PHDMgtCuGrdStDetails&memberid=1211) at the University of Kentucky and a member of the [LINKS Center for Social Network Analysis](https://sites.google.com/site/uklinkscenter/). I research social networks and organizations.

I love writing code. The world is digital, so I try to speak its language. This is a blog where I record and share my trials with coding. I do most of my analysis work in R, but I have a major project that I'm writing with JavaScript and NodeJS. I also dabble in some other languages like Julia, C++, and Python.
